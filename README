The code in this directory performs some exemplar analysis used in "Gava, G.P. et al. Integrating new memories into the hippocampal network activity space. Nat Neurosci 24, 326â€“330 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00804-w"

The Jupyter notebook 'cofiringTopology.ipynb' extracts the network parameters shown in Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 2 of the paper (i.e. strength, clustering coefficient ad geodesic path length) of one exemplar pre-computed co-firing graph per experiment type (i.e. CPP, SPP, novel only and familiar reward). These data are stored in the homonymous folder. Instructions on how to obtain co-firing graph from the neuron's spiketrains are provided in the notebook, but that step wasn't implemented here to avoid large data uploads. 
Moreover, in the notebook also the topological distance across co-firing graphs is computed and visualised (Fig. 2).
